abstract: 'Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a novel approach to generative
  modelling, a task whose goal it is to learn a distribution of real data points.
  They have often proved difficult to train: GANs are unlike many techniques in machine
  learning, in that they are best described as a two-player game between a discriminator
  and generator. This has yielded both unreliability in the training process, and
  a general lack of understanding as to how GANs converge, and if so, to what. The
  purpose of this dissertation is to provide an account of the theory of GANs suitable
  for the mathematician, highlighting both positive and negative results. This involves
  identifying the problems when training GANs, and how topological and game-theoretic
  perspectives of GANs have contributed to our understanding and improved our techniques
  in recent years.'
