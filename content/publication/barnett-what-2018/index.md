abstract: 'Decision theory has had a long-standing history in the behavioural and
  social sciences as a tool for constructing good approximations of human behaviour.
  Yet as artificially intelligent systems (AIs) grow in intellectual capacity and eventually
  outpace humans, decision theory becomes evermore important as a model of AI behaviour.
  What sort of decision procedure might an AI employ? In this work, I propose that policy-based
  causal decision theory (PCDT), which places a primacy on the decision-relevance of
  predictors and simulations of agent behaviour, may be such a procedure. I compare
  this account to the recently-developed functional decision theory (FDT), which is
  motivated by similar concerns. I also address potentially counterintuitive features
  of PCDT, such as its refusal to condition on observations made at certain times.'
